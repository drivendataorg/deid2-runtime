# NIST De-ID2 Challenge

This repository contains runtime configuration for the [NIST De-ID2 Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/) competition, as well as example benchmark solutions.

## Adding dependencies to the runtime

We accept contributions to add additional dependencies to the runtime environment. To do so, you'll have to follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository
2. Make your changes, test them, and commit using git
3. Open a pull request

Our repository is set up to run some automated tests using Azure Pipelines, and our team will review your pull request before merging.

If you're new to the GitHub contribution workflow, check out [this guide by GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

### Python

We use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to manage Python dependencies. Add your new dependencies to both `runtime/py-cpu.yml` and `runtime/py-gpu.yml`. Please also add your dependencies to `runtime/tests/test-installs.py`, below the line `## ADD ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS BELOW HERE ##`.

### R

We prefer to use conda to manage R dependencies. Take a look at what packages are available from [Anaconda's `pkgs/r`](https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r/) and from [`conda-forge`](https://conda-forge.org/feedstocks/). Note that R packages in conda typically start with the prefix `r-`. Add your new dependencies to both `runtime/r-cpu.yml` and `runtime/r-gpu.yml`.

If your dependencies are not available from the Anaconda or `conda-forge`, you can also add installation code to both the install scripts `runtime/package-installs-cpu.R` and `runtime/package-installs-gpu.R` to install from CRAN or GitHub.

Please also add your dependencies to `runtime/tests/test-installs.R`, below the line `## ADD ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS BELOW HERE ##`.

### Testing new dependencies locally

Please test your new dependency locally by recreating the relevant conda environment using the associated `.yml` file (and running the associated `package-installs-*.R` script if R). Try activating that environment and loading your new dependency.

If you would like to locally run our CI test (this requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)), you can use:

```bash
CPU_GPU=cpu  # or 'gpu' to use GPU
docker build --build-arg CPU_GPU=$CPU_GPU -t deid2/codeexecution runtime
docker run --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/runtime/run-tests.sh,target=/run-tests.sh,readonly \
                  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/runtime/tests,target=/tests,readonly \
                  deid2/codeexecution \
                  /bin/bash -c "bash /run-tests.sh $CPU_GPU"
```

### Opening a pull request

After making and testing your changes, commit your changes and push to your fork. Then, when viewing the repository on github.com, you will see a banner that lets you open the pull request. For more detailed instructions, check out [GitHub's help page](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

Once you open the pull request, Azure Pipelines will automatically try building the Docker images with your changes and run the tests in `runtime/tests`. These tests take up to an hour to run through, and may take longer if your build is queued behind others. You will see a section on the pull request page that shows the status of the tests and links to the logs.

You may be asked to submit revisions to your pull request if the tests fail, or if a DrivenData team member asks for revisions. Pull requests won't be merged until all tests pass and the team has reviewed and approved the changes.


## Testing your submission locally

It is a good idea to test your submission locally using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) before submitting to the platform. For a Python submission, place your code and model assets into `benchmark/run-py` and test images in `data`:

```
├── benchmark/run-py
│    ├── assets
│    │   ├── model.json
│    │   └── weights.h5
│    └── main.py
└── data
    ├── submission_format.csv
    ├── test_images
    │   ├── slide1.tif
    │   └── ...
    └── test_metadata.csv
```

Run `bash prep.sh`, which will prepare a `submission/submission.zip` file. Then run `bash run.sh` to build the Docker container and run the submission locally. If the submission completes successfully, you can be upload `submission.zip` as your submission to the platform and be fairly confident that it will run without error.
